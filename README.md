# Building a Reproducible Model Workflow

Create a Machine Learning Pipeline to solve the following problem: 
a property management company is renting rooms and properties in New York for short periods on various rental platforms. 
They need to estimate the typical price for a given property based on the price of similar properties. 
The company receives new data in bulk every week, so the model needs to be retrained with the same cadence, necessitating a reusable pipeline.
